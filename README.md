# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project is a machine learning pipeline built from scratch to predict rainfall. Using a Kaggle dataset, I performed:
- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created and selected meaningful features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Leveraged scikit-learn to train and test multiple machine learning models.

This mini-project highlights my ability to independently process raw datasets, apply machine learning concepts, and derive actionable insights from the data.

## Dataset
**Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](#)  
*(Include the link here if permissible. Otherwise, briefly describe how to access the dataset.)*

### Key Features
- Dataset contains [briefly describe features, e.g., weather conditions, temperature, etc.].
- Target variable: `Rainfall` (e.g., binary classification or regression).

---

## Workflow
1. **Load Dataset**:
   - Imported data using `pandas` and performed an exploratory data analysis (EDA).

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Standardized numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features to capture patterns in the data.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Trained and compared models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
